This project aims to create a **Sales Database Management System** to organize and analyze customer, product, and sales data efficiently. By designing structured tables for customers, products, and sales, the system enables accurate record-keeping and facilitates insightful analysis.

The purpose is to:
- Track customer purchases and sales trends.
- Identify top customers and most popular products.
- Analyze monthly sales performance for business decision-making.

The project also lays the foundation for generating data-driven insights through SQL queries, supporting future visualizations to enhance understanding and presentation of the sales data.
